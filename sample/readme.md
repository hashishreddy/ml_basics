is q1 over?


Harshil - The total lab is only one question right. Now, i have updated the code in the train and have added one more file. Just run both of them. Run the train code first and the val code next.

Please let me know if anything more is required
memory error is there


when we get memory error, we just have to close all the not necessary folders and try to run the code. if possible, just close the code editor and try to restart it again.



and i have done the trained the data with 5 more models. i will upload it as a seperate ipynb file in 2 minutes. please check that too. and submit that also. it might give an edge


only with vs code running it gives an error aswell i will ask sir okay pls upload under a different name


yeah sure. shall I just name train.ipynb, train_5_model.ipynb, val.ipynb ?



to fix the memory error sir asked to use a part of orginal data set
can you do tht?


okay sure. can I know where actually are you getting the error? I mean after running which cell ?



pooja i am hashish


do you want anything else


did you get everything


harshil - shall i send you the final csv file which contains all the labels? can you submit it directly? and i will also share the pdf, so that you can directly submit. is that okay?
