1)Goal: You will be performing a Binary classification problem. Predict whether a given website address is shady or legitimate.

Your dataset is from a group of cyber scientists who have classified different websites as bad or good websites (Most of the websites are shady and would have been blocked by Fortinet. Please don't try to load them). I let you explore the dataset by yourself rather than giving it in words.


2)Objective The variable you want to predict is 'label', which is in the last column of the dataset.
Evaluation

The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. Thus, it symmetrically represents both precision and recall in one metric. Evaluation of individual submission is compared with different F1 scores.
Submission File

For each ID in the test set, you must predict a probability for the TARGET variable. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

ID, label
2,0
5,1
6,0
etc.
